Hello! This is an example... Yes, an example!!! Waitâ€”why so many punctuations?
Well... it's simple: punctuation, such as commas, periods, and exclamations should not matter!
Numbers like 12345, or symbols like %, &, and $, should be ignored!
Wait... did I mention, that "Hello" is the same as "hello"? Well, it is! :)
